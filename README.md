# RocketGame (Unity)

This is a Unity game project created independently as part of my learning journey in game development.  
The game focuses on physics-based movement, game logic, and modular C# code organization.

## 🎮 Project Overview

**RocketGame** is a 3D game in which the player controls a rocket that must overcome various obstacles to reach a designated destination. The game mechanics emphasize:
- responsive controls
- physics-based movement
- collision detection
- simple game state management (e.g., win/lose conditions)

This project demonstrates my ability to apply programming logic and game design concepts in Unity.

## 🧠 Key Features

- **Player Movement:** Rocket controlled with physics-based forces  
- **Collision Handling:** Detects interactions with obstacles and boundaries  
- **Game Logic:** Handles game states such as success and failure  
- **Modular Scripts:** Each script responsible for a single function (clear separation of concerns)

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Unity (Game Engine)**
- **C# (Programming Language)**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Basic Sprite & Asset Usage**
