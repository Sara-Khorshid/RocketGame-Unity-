# RocketGame (Unity)

This is a Unity game project created independently as part of my learning journey in game development.  
The game focuses on physics-based movement, game logic, and modular C# code organization.

## 🎮 Project Overview

**RocketGame** is a 3D game in which the player controls a rocket that must overcome various obstacles to reach a designated destination. The game mechanics emphasize:
- responsive controls
- physics-based movement
- collision detection
- simple game state management (e.g., win/lose conditions)

This project demonstrates my ability to apply programming logic and game design concepts in Unity.

## 🧠 Key Features

- **Player Movement:** Rocket controlled with physics-based forces  
- **Collision Handling:** Detects interactions with obstacles and boundaries  
- **Game Logic:** Handles game states such as success and failure  
- **Modular Scripts:** Each script responsible for a single function (clear separation of concerns)

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Unity (Game Engine)**
- **C# (Programming Language)**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Basic Sprite & Asset Usage**

### Notes:
1. Use `plaintext` or `text` after the opening backticks to avoid syntax highlighting interfering with tree characters.
2. Make sure all spacing and alignment is exactly as in your example, so the tree looks correct.
3. You can also use just triple backticks without specifying `plaintext`:
