# RocketGame (Unity)

This is a Unity game project created independently as part of my learning journey in game development.  
The game focuses on physics-based movement, game logic, and modular C# code organization.

---

## 🎮 Project Overview

**RocketGame** is a 3D game in which the player controls a rocket that must overcome various obstacles to reach a designated destination. The game mechanics emphasize:
- responsive controls
- physics-based movement
- collision detection
- simple game state management (e.g., win/lose conditions)

This project demonstrates my ability to apply programming logic and game design concepts in Unity.

## 🧠 Key Features

- **Player Movement:** Rocket controlled with physics-based forces  
- **Collision Handling:** Detects interactions with obstacles and boundaries  
- **Game Logic:** Handles game states such as success and failure  
- **Modular Scripts:** Each script responsible for a single function (clear separation of concerns)

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Unity (Game Engine)**
- **C# (Programming Language)**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Basic Sprite & Asset Usage**

- `RocketController.cs` – Handles player input and physics movement  
- `ObstacleHandler.cs` – Manages interactions and responses to collisions  
- `GameStateManager.cs` – Controls win/lose conditions and scene transitions

## 🚀 Learning Goals

Through developing this project I strengthened my skills in:
- Game development fundamentals in Unity
- Using C# with object-oriented design
- Applying math and physics concepts in gameplay
- Organizing game code for readability and extendability

## 👩‍💻 About Me

I work on Unity projects because I enjoy the creative and technical combination of game development. I am continuously learning new tools and patterns to become a better developer. I’m currently also developing another game project called **Galaxy Strike**, which I can share upon request.

## 📩 Notes

If you would like to review additional source code, project files, or other formats (e.g., the full Unity project for Galaxy Strike), I will be happy to provide them.
